# Machine-Learning-to-Predict-Heart-Disease: Project Overview
As an introduction to data science and to apply my currently learned skills, this project was culminated. The goal of this project is to go through the data science life cycle applying fundamental techniques to a subject topic that I've been curious of - predicting heart disease.
#### Data Description:
This was done by using the Cleveland heart disease dataset.  Throughout this project I use a basic data science and ML pipeline: - Data cleaning - Exploratory data analysis - Hypothesis testing (chi-square / t-test) - Data modeling - Data analysis of results  This project has allowed me to simply apply what I have learned. Using multiple logistic regression in R, my model was able to reach an accuracy level of 0.71. I look forward to improving this model by including more predictors that are relevant in the future.
